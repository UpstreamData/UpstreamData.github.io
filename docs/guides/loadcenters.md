# Loadcenter Guide

## Receiving
- Remove shipping protection from the outside of the building
- Ensure there is nothing obstructing the exhaust dampers
- Ensure the intakes can be opened
- Ensure the filters are free of debris
- Check for any damage to the exterior of the building

For optimal performance, Upstream Data recommends orienting the building parallel to prevailing wind directions.
For even more performance, we also suggest placing the unit on piles, or raised framework.

When placing multiple loadcenters near each other, we suggest at least 8ft between the outside walls.

## Grounding

All loadcenters must be bonded to ground prior to operation, either:

- To an existing ground system on site, or
- a new ground which complies with the electrical code in your jurisdiction.

!!! danger
    Improper or missing grounding can result in electrical issues, instability, and serious damage to components.
    
    Failure to properly ground the loadcenter will void your warranty.
    

## Shrouds and recirculation

All modern loadcenters come with fold-out shrouds which are used to deflect heat away from the intakes,
and can be configured to recirculate heat during winter months.
These shrouds should be folded out, and screwed in place with Tek screws prior to operation.

??? info "Older loadcenters"
    On some older loadcenters, the shrouds come disassembled.
    Upon receiving them, they will need to be assembled, using Tek screws and an impact driver.
    
    !!! warning
        Remember to use gloves and PPE when working around sharp metal edges.

    To assemble them, follow this process:

    1. Lay the outer casing out flat, with the flanges for screwing facing down.
    2. Put the sliding heat recirculation holder in place inside of it.
        The slot for the heat recirculation slider should be just outside of the metal of the casing.
    3. Screw the casing and slider holder together to attach them.
    4. Add the deflectors, starting at the bottom. They should all face
        away from the slider. Screw these to the casing to secure them.

        !!! note
            Some building have 4 deflectors per shroud, other have 5.
            Split the deflectors up as needed to ensure each shroud has the same amount of deflectors.

    5. Insert the heat deflector slider.

    The images below illustrate this process.
